For Tassia:

1. The switchImage() method in the Dragon class does not work when called
in the BabyDragon class. I tried to un-parametrize it and see if the problem
was in the method, but it worked. As soon as I parametrized again it stopped
working for some reason - the images dont switch.

2. I'm not sure what to do about my DinoRush mini game's scrolling world. I don't
think it looks right. Suggestions?
