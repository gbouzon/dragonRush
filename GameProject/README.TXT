------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Tassia:

1. The switchImage() method in the Dragon class does not work when called
in the BabyDragon class. I tried to un-parametrize it and see if the problem
was in the method, but it worked. As soon as I parametrized again it stopped
working for some reason - the images dont switch.  --FIXED (sort of)

2. I'm not sure what to do about my DinoRush mini game's scrolling world. I don't
think it looks right. Suggestions?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things to be fixed/implemented:

1. scaling of animation for PacMan game (in BabyDragon class)
2. Skill percentage method doesn't work (????)
3. Edit screens to fix typos/ style for Credits screen
4. Fix fire animation/ disappear
5. Work on gameOver conditions
6. Add more enemies to levels 2 and 3 and more allies to level 1
7. Create gameOver screen
8. Decide condition for restart (back to menu, level 1 or each level?)
9. Work on overall animations and maybe consider changing dragon (no up/down imgs)
10. Fix discrepacy in jump method (when it's on block)
11. Figure out how to make scrolling background without delay (Background class)
12. Edit place for Menu button (maybe make white button the default) --color
13. Add impact to enemies/ world when attack() method (fire)
14. Fix fruits appearance in DinoRush game --not on block
